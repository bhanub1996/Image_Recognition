Upload Images to S3 Bucket: The first step is to upload the images to an S3 bucket in AWS. This can be done manually or automatically using an AWS service like AWS Lambda.

Use Amazon Rekognition: Once the images are uploaded to the S3 bucket, you can use Amazon Rekognition, which is an AWS service that provides image and video analysis, to detect the locations in the images. Amazon Rekognition can recognize and detect objects, scenes, and faces in images.

Create an AWS Lambda Function: After detecting the locations in the images using Amazon Rekognition, you can create an AWS Lambda function to process the data. The Lambda function can be used to perform any additional processing on the data, such as resizing images or saving the data to a database.

Store the Results: Finally, you can store the results of the location detection in a database or another data store, such as Amazon DynamoDB or Amazon S3. This will allow you to access and analyze the data later.
